## Philosophy & Approach

> “Speed is the only moat.”  
>  
> Constraints fuel clarity. Shipping prototypes uncovers truths that planning never will.

> “Success is ecological, not self-made.”  
>  
> Every achievement rests on visible and invisible infrastructures of knowledge, access, and permission.
